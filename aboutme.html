                    <p>My career goal is to become a Software Developer and work for big companies. I initialized my plan last year by taking the Computer Science Principles course at my school to enhance and expand my range of understanding when it comes to the various programming languages within the coding industry. Additionally, I am now taking Computer Science A my senior year to learn a more complex language like Java. Moreover, I have been contemplating my decisions for around two years when it comes to a career, but when I got into coding it became an addiction. Over time, I knew this was the career for me, I want to advance with technology as it evolves and not stay in the loop of medieval times. Therefore, upon reviewing the potential Software Development has, it is clear that my decision is made. Not only do I see my future career as a hobby that will bring in income, but it is also my form of entertainment as I am a persistent learner.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my short time of being an intermediate programmer and learning the arts of computer science, I have improved my skills and understandings within this field. I contain numerous qualities influenced by my parents and my culture, I firmly believe my parents have pushed me to become the persistent, hard-working, and determined individual that I am today. I have many morals that have built my character and I am content with these morals because without them I would not have gotten involved in programming and pursuing a life-changing career.</p>
                    <p>I have had numerous accomplishments throughout my short journey with programming. For example, when I was 14 I founded and managed an entire network of servers for players on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and had hundreds of online players with over 20 live servers. I hosted for approximately 9 months and profited in revenue monthly. However, I shut down the network due to lack of time with school starting, and a decline in players as competition became fierce, and new games were being released frequently shifting the interest of players.</p>
