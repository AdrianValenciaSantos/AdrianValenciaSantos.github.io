            <p class="pinfo2">My career goal is to obtain a Bachelors's in Computer Science and work for big industries as a programmer. I have initialized my plan by taking the Computer Science courses at my school to enhance and expand my range of understanding when it comes to languages within computer science. Moreover, I have been contemplating my decisions for years when it comes to a career, and when I got into coding it became an addiction. Over time, I knew this was the career for me, I want to advance with technology and be alongside it as it evolves and not stay out of the loop. Therefore, not only do I see my future career as a hobby that will bring in income, but it is also my form of entertainment as I am a persistent learner and thrilled to advance further in my career.</p>
