        <p class="pinfo2">If you would like to download this app on your Android device then click <a href="/apps/androidapp.apk">here</a> to download, unfortunately, IOS compatability is not supported! Sorry IOS users...</p>
        <br>
        <p class="pinfo2">The development of my app consisted of a program called <a target="_blank" href="https://thunkable.com/">Thunkable</a>, which allowed me to drag and drop blocks of code, eventually leading to the creation of my functional app. I developed my app by creating buttons that had attached blocks of code so when the button is pressed, an audio file is played, resulting in the stimulation of this character consuming products with the audio included. Also, I added a weight counter which calculates the weight of this character when he is fed and when the fat button is pressed to forcefully increase the weight of this character. I did this by creating a variable for clicks, which registers the number of times the user has clicked the button to increase the character's weight, as well as to add the total of the weight when the button is clicked simultaneously. However, the development of this app was not easy, during my development phase, I encountered multiple problems. For example, when I created the clicks variable and tried to count the clicks while adding the weight together in a math block, I had issues with printing the integer total of the character's weight due to the weight getting set to zero every click, instead of printing the digit, It would export the answer, “Not a number” in the abbreviated form of "Nan". As a result, I created a separate function that set the weight counter to zero when the game screen opened, which fixed the issue of the weight counter. Furthermore, another problem I encountered was when the audio file was played, it would not get sent if the user simultaneously clicked the button. Consequently, I looped the audio strings so they would repeat even if the user was not patient with feeding the man. In conclusion, these were the only incidents I had which occurred in errors, and app crashes, however, I was able to get them fixed, and this app was independent development as there were no collaborators in this project.</p>
