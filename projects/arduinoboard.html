		<p class="pinfo2">The development of our Arduino board consisted of a program called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, which allowed us to manually program the functionality of our board.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="pinfo2">We developed the board script by locating the ports specifically the ones being modified with code, and added their functionality through our script which was uploaded to the Arduino board. We had an issue with the temperature display as it would not display the correct temperature.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="pinfo2">In addition, we also had issues with the Arduino board as we had the wrong libraries installed which was causing it to crash. However, we installed the proper libraries and eventually were able to get the temperature display to work with the right libraries and code.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="pinfo2">Nonetheless, it was a blast to work on this collaborative project with my partner, <a target="_blank" href="https://gabu-chan.github.io/">Gabe</a>. We successfully managed to create a functional temperature checker with our Arduino Board and overcame many obstacles while working with this form of programming.</p>
